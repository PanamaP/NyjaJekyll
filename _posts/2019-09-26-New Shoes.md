# Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 High OG TS

# Travis Scott Jordan 1 Buyer’s Guide
# Cost: $175

## Color: Sail/Black-Dark Mocha-University Red
## Style Code: CD4487-100


After months of unfettered anticipation, two shock drops, and plenty of speculation, the Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 is finally set to release tomorrow. With Scott’s white-hot popularity and the AJ1’s current standing as Jordan Brand’s foremost retro silhouette, the shoes are nothing short of a perfect storm of hype. However, they’re certainly not all sizzle and no steak. The design stacks up as well with its bold backwards lateral Swoosh, hidden stash pocket, and versatile sail/brown/black colorway. Although we’re not even 50% of the way through 2019 yet, many pundits have La Flame’s AJ1s pegged as their preemptive pick for shoe of the year, and for good reason: it’s certainly difficult to see another sneaker generating — and then sustaining — this level of buzz. Although most raffles have already closed, you’ll still get to try your luck at some spots tomorrow, so take one final look at the design right here.
